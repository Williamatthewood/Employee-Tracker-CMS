# Employee-Tracker-CMS

## Description
A command line application for navigating a small employee database. The data is stored using SQL and is persistent. Users can get current data and update the database all while using the application. The menus are easy to navigate once the program is running.


## Usage
After building and seeding the database with the schema.sql and seeds.sql files, simply navigate to the root of the project and run 'npm i' in your terminal. Then, run 'npm start.' The application will immediately stat and you can use your arrow keys and the enter button to answer the questions. When you are finished, simply navigate down to the "Exit" command.
